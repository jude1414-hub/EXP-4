# Experiment 4: DeFi Lending and Borrowing Protocol
# Aim:
To build a decentralized lending protocol where users can deposit assets to earn interest and borrow assets by providing collateral. This experiment introduces concepts like overcollateralization, liquidity pools, and interest accrual in DeFi.

# Algorithm:
Step 1: Setup Lending and Borrowing Mechanism
Users deposit ETH into the contract as liquidity.


Depositors receive interest based on their deposits.


Borrowers can borrow ETH but must provide collateral (e.g., 150% of the borrowed amount).


Interest on borrowed funds is calculated dynamically based on utilization rate.


Step 2: Implement Overcollateralization
If a borrowerâ€™s collateral value drops below a certain liquidation threshold, their collateral is liquidated to repay the debt.


Step 3: Allow Liquidation
If collateral < liquidation threshold, liquidators can repay the borrower's debt and claim their collateral at a discount.

# High-Level Overview:
Teaches key DeFi concepts: lending, borrowing, collateral, liquidation.


Introduces risk management: overcollateralization and liquidation.


Directly related to DeFi protocols like Aave and Compound.
